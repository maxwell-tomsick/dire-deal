HOW TO PLAY:

When players start the game, they will be presented with the event deck and the current enemy. 
Clicking the top of the deck will reveal the card (swiping on mobile), and display the responses 
available for the card. 

Each response has an image of an event card (which can be previewed by hovering their mouse or 
holding their finger over the response), and a cost corresponding to one of four resources, displayed 
above the response options:
- Blade: the yellow symbol
- Flourish: the grey symbol
- Lunge: the teal symbol
- Brawn: the orange symbol

If players have sufficient resources for a response, they can click on that response to spend resources, 
which will place the card displayed on that response in the next event deck, and remove the current 
card from play.

Alternatively, players can drag a card to the part of the screen beneath the deck, where they can "burn"
the card, exchanging it for a defined amount of resources (visible when dragging the card or previewing it
from a response). In this case, no cards are put into the next deck.

Once the event deck is emptied, the next deck is shuffled, and becomes the new deck. If there are no cards
in the next deck, then players lose the game.

HOW TO WIN:

As players pick responses, the colors of the responses may change, with a darker background indicating
that that card is relatively closer to "victory." Players win a fight when they choose a blue response, which
displays the "Incapacitated" card.

After winning a fight, players will immediately be put into the next fight (currently, all fights are identical
besides the number of available responses). Resources persist across fights, and a run is completed after four 
fights. After a run is won or lost, players can return to the main menu.
