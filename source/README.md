HOW TO PLAY:

When players start the game, they will be presented with the event deck and the current enemy. 
Clicking the top of the deck will reveal the card (swiping on mobile), and display the responses 
available for the card. 

Each response has an image of an event card (which can be previewed by hovering their mouse or 
holding their finger over the response), and a cost corresponding to one of four resources, displayed 
above the response options:
- Blade: the yellow symbol
- Flourish: the grey symbol
- Lunge: the red symbol
- Brawn: the orange symbol

If players have sufficient resources for a response, they can click on that response to spend resources, which will place the card displayed on that response in the next event deck, and remove the current card from play.

Alternatively, players can drag a card to the fire beneath the deck, where they can "burn"
the card, exchanging it for a defined amount of resources. In this case, no cards are put into the next deck.

Once the event deck is emptied, the next deck is shuffled, and becomes the new deck. If there are no cards in the next deck, then players lose the game.

HOW TO WIN:

The goal of the game is to shuffle a level 5 card into the deck. Card levels are shown at the bottom of the card, where the number of filled in diamonds corresponds to the level of the card. The color of the response corresponds to the level of the card it will shuffle in (see color code below). All responses will shuffle in cards that are either higher or the same level as the current card, so players must shuffle higher and higher level cards into the deck, until they reach the level 5 card.

Color Code:
Level 1 = Yellow
Level 2 = Orange
Level 3 = Light Red
Level 4 = Dark Red
Level 5 = Blue

After winning a fight, players will immediately be put into the next fight. 
Resources persist across fights, and a run is completed after four 
fights. After a run is won or lost, players can return to the main menu.

ITEMS:

Currently, there are 5 equippable items in the game that can be selected from the item menu before starting the game. Tap one of the green cards on the left side of the menu to see what item it is, and then tap the large card to equip. Alternatively, tap on the black card to unequip an equipped item. The items are cards that will be shuffled into the deck at the beginning of every fight unless otherwise stated here. The specific items are as follows:

Flourish Regen: No Responses. Sells for 3 Flourish

Lunge Regen: No Responses. Sells for 4 Lunge

Second Wind: When the player sells their last card that isn't this one, this card becomes a copy of the card they just sold. Once used, this item will no longer be shuffled into the deck at the beginning of subsequent fights. 

Deck Boost: 1 Response to shuffle itself into the next deck for free. Sells for a randomly-typed resource for the number of cards in the current + next deck.

Parasite: 1 Response to shuffle itself into the next deck, for 1 of each resource. Sells for nothing. When the next deck is shuffled, if this item is in it, a random response to a random card in the next deck will be free.

Items will show up in the game as the "Incapacitated" card, which is a placeholder asset.

SLIME FIGHT:

The second fight of the game features our brand-new Slime enemy. This enemy feautres 1 special card: Poison Gas. This card cannot be sold, and each of it's responses shuffle itself into the next deck, as well as remove a card from either the current or next deck. Happy hunting!
